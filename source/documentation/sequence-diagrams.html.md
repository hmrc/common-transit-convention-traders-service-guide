# Sequence diagrams
<!--- Section owner: CTC Traders API --->

We have split our journey maps into two categories. One to provide an overview of how our CTC Traders API will fit into your trading messages. The other category has more technical sequence diagrams to help developers understand the kind of responses they can expect. 

## An overview of the end to end journey

**[End-to-end journey](movements-diagram.html)** - See a simplified end-to-end process of transporting goods using the CTC Traders API.

**[Simplified arrivals process](arrivals-diagram.html.md)**  - See a simplified process of sending an arrivals message.


## Technical coders' diagrams

We will be updating this section with diagrams before the API goes into the test environment.

To review our technical documentation, please see **[NCTS Phase 4 Technical Interface Specification (TIS)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/641488/NCTSPhase4TISv3_9_3.pdf)**. This will be updated on 31 December 2020.
